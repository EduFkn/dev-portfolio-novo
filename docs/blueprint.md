# **App Name**: Aetherweave Portfolio

## Core Features:

- Theme Toggle: Implement a light/dark theme toggle for user preference.
- Page Transitions: Smooth transitions and animations for page navigation to enhance user experience.
- Project Sections: Categorize projects into sections for easy browsing and filtering.
- NavBar: A clean and minimal navigation bar that links to the different sections of the portfolio.
- About me: Include a detailed 'About Me' section with information about skills, experience, and background.
- Projects Showcase: Showcase projects with descriptions, images, and links to live demos or repositories.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Purple (#A06CD5) to provide a strong but elegant visual identity, in alignment with current web design trends.
- Background color: Dark Gray (#23272F) for a modern, sophisticated feel that complements the purple accents.
- Accent color: Lavender (#D8B4F1) to create subtle highlights without overwhelming the primary purple.
- Headline font: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for a precise, contemporary, fashionable look. Body font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a neutral, readable look. The 'Inter' font is well suited for use with 'Poppins', and provides the reader a respite from Poppins's sometimes overpowering geometry.
- Utilize a grid-based layout to maintain visual consistency across all sections.
- Incorporate subtle parallax scrolling effects to add depth and visual interest as the user navigates the page.
- Implement hover animations on project thumbnails and navigation elements for interactive feedback.
